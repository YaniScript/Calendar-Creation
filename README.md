# Calendar-Creation

I really enjoy the idea of this application, as I am a person who is obsessed with calendars and use them frequently in my everyday life.
I struggled to conceptualize this application after my tutoring session. I went back to watch the videos and couldn't really wrap my mind 
  around it.

Nonetheless, the HTML code is in the index.html
The little bit of CSS and Javascript that I have is in the assets folder, in their respective folders.
  The CSS file is called style.css
  The Javascript file is called script.js
